# CritterWorld2

A simple simulator used for first-year programming modules, and a step forward
from the original Critterworld.

Once you've loaded the project into Visual Studio, right-click on the CritterWorld subproject and select "Set as StartUp Project".

Then build (Build | Build Solution) the project. If your first run can't find any Critter controllers to load, select build (Build | Build Solution) again and the DemonstrationCritters.dll DLL should get built.

See the Documentation subproject, particularly _Specification of Requirements for a Critter Controller.pdf_, for further information.
